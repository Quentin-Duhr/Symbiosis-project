# Results

This folder contains **outputs from analyses and models**, such as figures, tables, and summary statistics.  

## Rules
- Do not store raw or intermediate data here.
- Organize results by analysis or figure number (e.g., `figures/`, `tables/`).
- Make results reproducible: every file here should be regenerable from scripts in `scripts/`.

## Examples
- `figures/figure1_survival_curves.png`
- `tables/survival_equations.csv`
- `summary/gdm_results_summary.txt`
