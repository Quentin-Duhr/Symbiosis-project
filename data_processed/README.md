# Processed Data

This folder contains **cleaned and transformed datasets** generated from raw data.  
These are outputs from scripts in `scripts/` and are used for analysis and modeling.

## Rules
- Do not edit these files manually.
- Always document which script created a given processed dataset.
- Use consistent file formats (e.g., `.csv`).

## Examples
- `symbiont_survival_clean.csv` (from `scripts/01_clean_survival_data.R`)
- `env_variables_standardized.csv`
