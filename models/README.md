# Models

This folder contains scripts, functions, or outputs related to **statistical or mechanistic models**.

## Rules
- Each model should have a short description (in script header or separate file).
- Use subfolders if multiple modeling approaches are developed.

## Examples
- `survival_models/` (decay rate estimation)
- `growth_models/` (Chakravarti growth functions)
- `gdm/` (beta-diversity GDM analysis)

## Notes
Model outputs (figures, tables) should be saved to `results/`, not here.
