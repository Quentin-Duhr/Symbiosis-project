# Symbiosis-project
Idea of structure
# Symbiosis Mechanistic Model

This repository contains data, scripts, and models to study coralâ€“symbiont dynamics across multiple reef sites and temperature regimes.  
The workflow is designed to be **modular and extensible**, so that new sites can be added without restructuring the project.

#        Repository structure

- **`data_raw/`**  
  Raw input data, separated by site (e.g., Shark Bay, Site2, Site3).  
  These files are not modified and serve as the primary source of truth.

- **`data_processed/`**  
  Cleaned and processed datasets generated by the scripts.  
  Output is stored in subfolders per site to avoid mixing.

- **`scripts/`**  
  All R scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.  
  Scripts are written to be **generic**: each script can be run for any site by specifying the site name.

- **`models/`**  
  Mechanistic and Bayesian models (e.g., Stan files).  
  These define the mathematical/statistical structure of the analysis.

- **`results/`**  
  All results are organized by site: figures, tables, and summaries.  
  This allows direct comparison between sites.

- **`docs/`**  
  Additional documentation, such as pipeline overviews, notes, and background information.

#        Workflow

1. **Load raw data** from `data_raw/[site_name]`.  
2. **Process data** using scripts in `scripts/`.  
3. **Run models** defined in `models/`.  
4. **Store outputs** in `results/[site_name]`.  

Example:
```r
source("scripts/04_site_analysis.R")
run_analysis(site = "shark_bay")
